#Task 
#Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

#1.The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
#2.The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).1.
#3.The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

#Input Format
#The first line contains the first integer, . The second line contains the second integer, .

#Constraints
# 1 <= a <= 10^5
# 1 <= b <= 10^5


#Output Format
#Print the three lines as explained above.

#Sample Input 0
#3
#2

#Sample Output 0
#5
#1
#6

#Explanation 0
#3 + 2 = 5
#3 - 1 = 2
#3 * 2 = 6


#The code is here

a = int(input())
b = int(input())


print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
